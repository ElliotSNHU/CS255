System Analysis and Design

The DriverPass project aimed to develop a web-based application targeting students preparing for their driving tests at the DMV. The client sought a system that could offer online testing modules to improve students' knowledge, schedule in-person driving sessions with instructors, and provide valuable feedback to enhance their driving skills.

What did you do particularly well?

I created well designed UML documents that displayed correct information in a neat and easy to interpret design. I spent time reading over the interview transcripts to garner a complete understanding of what the client wanted to deliver to their customer. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One part of my work that I would improve upon would be my level of detail during design. I left out components that had multiple loops that lead back to the initial point. This was the case, mostly for redundancy and clarity. The loops did not need to be added to my sequences as it should be easily interpreted. In the future, my sequence diagrams will be designed at a greater scale with 100% clarity and details.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interpreting user needs was pivotal in driving the system design process. Understanding the challenges students face in preparing for their driving tests and the need for convenient scheduling and constructive feedback shaped the design decisions. Considering user needs is crucial as it ensures that the system caters to the audience's preferences and challenges, increasing user adoption and satisfaction.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to designing software involves a user-centric methodology. For future system analysis and design, I'd employ techniques like user interviews, surveys, and usability testing to gather comprehensive user requirements. Techniques such as persona creation, user journey mapping, and prototyping would help visualize and understand user interactions, leading to more intuitive and effective system designs.
